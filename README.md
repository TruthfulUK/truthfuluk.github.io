# Personal Site

This is just the code for my (very basic) personal site, built using HTML5, CSS (compiled from SCSS) and hopefully some JavaScript in the future when I get around to it!

#### Honorable mentions

Fontawesome - https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/

#### Can I use this for my own site?

Sure, go ahead!
